I am a third year PhD student in Economics at Emory University. I am currently working on methodological research on causal inference with network interference, and external validity of social experiments: together with their applications to Development Economics. Here at Emory I have accumulated experience on social research on human subjects, including the assistance for the construction of successful major grant applications, quality control of incoming survey data and formal training for IRB submissions. I have also assited on the construction of a replicable package for a top journal publication. In terms of teaching experience, I have been asisstant for two honors causal inference classes at Emory. As a consequence of the human contact that all this journey has meant to me, I have learned how to promote a productive, yet pedagogical and enjoyable experience for my teammates and myself.
