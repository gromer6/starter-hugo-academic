I just finished the first year of the Econ PhD program, where I had extensive training on Econometric Methods, Micro and Macroeconomic Theory. Now I am specializing on the applications of the Econometrics of Networks. I am an AEA Summer Program scholar. I obtained my BA degree in economics with focus on advanced quantitative courses. I have worked as RA and TA for most of my educational process. As a consequence, I do not only have the technical and analytical skills that academia or the private sector demands: Soft skills such as my preference for teamwork and an attitude to overcome new challenges are also some of my qualities.
